    <div id="sect2Div">
      <p>Danielle Forrest is an aspiring front-end and mobile apps developer working towards a degree in computer science and
        also art.
        <br>
        <br> Previously a chef, Danielle has chosen programming as a new career due to the creative fulfillment and abundant
        job opportunities. As much as she appreciates art, she does not see herself as an artist. Her art degree is intended
        to enhance her abilities as a front-end developer. She sees programming as an artistic medium that can benefit from
        the fundamentals of traditional fine arts.
        <br>
        <br> Danielle hopes to one day work remotely, so she can travel the world with her husband. She will graduate with both
        degrees in May, 2018.
