    <p1>That second page will be a full screen takeover - there will be no scrolling to see
        additional content. At a minimum, you should have some color or image covering the full
        screen and an inner container that holds content of some kind (text, image, shapes
        made with css, etc). Add some kind of hover state with transition to at least one element
        on this page. Understanding transitions and applying changes to elements is an
        important piece in taking your webpage to the next level. To get some ideas, you can
        search for fullscreen webpage designs. Here are a couple links to get you started:
